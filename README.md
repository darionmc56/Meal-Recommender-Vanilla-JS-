# 🍽️ Daily Meal Recommender (Vanilla JS)

A simple, beginner-friendly meal recommender app that suggests a random **breakfast**, **lunch**, and **dinner** based on the user's selected goal: **Healthy**, **Bulking**, or **Budget**.

This is a static MVP built with **vanilla JavaScript** — no APIs, no AI, no backend yet. It focuses on core JavaScript skills and DOM manipulation as a foundational project.

## 🚀 Features

- 🔁 Click a button to generate a new random daily meal plan
- 📄 Meals are shown clearly on the page (not just in the console)

## 🌱 Future Plans

This MVP is the foundation for a more advanced, AI-enhanced meal planning app. Here's what's coming next:

### 🧠 Intelligence & Personalization

- **OpenAI API integration** to generate meal plans based on:  
  - Dietary restrictions (e.g., vegetarian, gluten-free)  
  - Personal preferences (e.g., no fish, more rice-based meals)  
  - Macros or calorie targets  
- Add support for user prompts like: *"Give me a low-carb bulking meal plan for under $15."*

### 🧩 App Features

- **Meal lock and regenerate** — let users lock individual meals and regenerate only others  
- **Favorite/save meal plan** — localStorage or simple backend for saving meals  
- **Share plan** — create sharable links or download as PDF  
- **Nutrition facts** — basic calories/macros next to each meal (optional static for now)

### 🎨 Design & UX

- Rebuild in **React + Tailwind CSS**  
- Use **Next.js** to prepare for server-side AI integration  
- Improve mobile responsiveness and animations  
- Add images or icons for each meal type

### 📦 Deployment & Hosting

- Deploy MVP to **GitHub Pages**  
- Deploy React version to **Netlify or Vercel**  
- Add a **custom domain** and portfolio link
